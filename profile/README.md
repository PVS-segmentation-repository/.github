# Welcome to the GitHub organisation page for the Perivascular space (PVS) segmentation repository!

## The PVS segmentation platform
Here, you will be able to find a collection of available code to aid with PVS segmentation. This PVS segmetation code collection library aims to collect and share open-source code related to the segmentation and quantification of perivascular spaces based on MRI data, to be used in research and software development.

Code contributions can include any code or pipelines related PVS quantification (preprocessing, filters, networks, quantification algorithms, etc.), written in any programming language. In our initial phase, the code that can be found in this repository will not have been tested by the repository maintainers.

## Interested to join and share?
In order to share your code or pipeline for PVS segmentation on this platform, we ask you to:

**1. Review and clean your code**

Make sure your code is commented and easy to follow for everyone with a basic understanding of the methods. Remove any unnecessary or commented-out code and ensure consistent identation throughout your code. Confirm that no sensitive data, such as API keys, passwords, or personal information is present in the code or configuration files. 

**2. Add clear documentation**

Include a README file that explains the purpose, usage, and setup of the code. Comment on complex or non-obvious sections within the code itself to aid understanding.

**3. Ensure that you agree with the license of this platform**

This platform falls under the Apache License 2.0, which is a widely-used license that allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute your code, both in private and commercial projects. Here's what it means for you as a contributor:
+ *You keep your rights*: When you upload code, you still own your work. You're simply giving permission for others to use it under the terms of the Apache License.
+ *Your code will be Open-Source*: Any code you contribute will be openly available for others to use, modify, and share. They must follow the same license terms.
+ *Credit where credit is due*: If others use or distribute your code, they must give proper credit. This usually means including your name and a copy of the Apache License in their project.
+ *No warranty or liability*: You are not responsible if something goes wrong when others use your code.
+ *Incompatible changes*: If someone modifies your code, they have to clearly indicate what changes they made. They cannot blame you for issues caused by their modifications.
+ *Patents*: If your contribution includes something that could be patented, you're also giving users a license to use to patented parts of your contribution. This helps project everyone from potential patent lawsuits related to your code.

**4. Include the Apache License 2.0 notice in your code**

Also make sure to mention all contributing authors and add contact details in case of questions/comments. 

**5. Choose or create a repository that fits your PVS segmentation approach best**

We aim to collect similar methodologies in overarching repositories. If you feel that existing repositories do not capture your approach, request the creation of a new one.

**6. Create a pull request to upload your code**

Inside the respository that you have decided to upload your code to, create a pull request to be approved by the maintainers. 

**7. Engage with the PVS community**

Be prepared to answer questions or address issues that users might encounter, or consider setting up a contribution guide if you welcome contributions.
